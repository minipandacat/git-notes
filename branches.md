A git branch is a pointer to what have changes you have made, a snapshot basically. A simplified way to think of  it
is to think of a tree. Or you can think of it as a plant, but a tree is easier. You have the main trunk which contains the main code/directory, and 
any changes or commits are the branches. A branch is the tip of a series of commits, its not an actual container of commits. A branch is not a tree, the main trunk is.
